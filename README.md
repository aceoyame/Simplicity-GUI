# Simplicity-GUI
An easy way to mine MyriadCoin
I got busy with other projects but this was working for the most part and just needs some minor tweaking to use the
proper .exe based of of the current hardware config.
This relies on Simplicity being in the referenced folder.  The files should be included in this repo.
